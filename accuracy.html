            <h2>Sources of Potential Inaccuracy</h2>
            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Sample Size and Representation:</strong> While we use data from comprehensive studies, these still represent a limited sample of the global population.</li>
                <li><strong>Population Differences:</strong> We provide averages for different populations, but there can be significant individual variation within each group.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Data on Certain Populations:</strong> Some populations may be underrepresented in scientific studies due to various factors.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Percentile Calculations:</strong> We use the z-score method, assuming a normal distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume and Surface Area Estimates:</strong> These assume a cylindrical shape, which is a simplification.</li>
                <li><strong>Condom Size Recommendations:</strong> Based on general guidelines, may not account for individual preferences.</li>
