                <li>Achieve a full erection.</li>
                <li>Place the measuring tape or ruler on top of the penis.</li>
                <li>Press the base of the ruler firmly against the pubic bone at the base of the penis.</li>
                <li>Measure from the base to the tip of the glans (head).</li>
